//---> Introduction to Programming

/*
    Programming is the process of writing instructions that a computer can follow
    to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language.

    Why Programming?
    - Automate tasks
    - Solve complex problems
    - Build applications, websites, games, and systems
    - Communicate with computers in a structured way

    Components OF Programming:
    - Syntax: The rules of the language (e.g., how to write loops, functions).
    - Semantics: The meaning of instructions.
    - Variables & Data: Storing information for processing.
    - Control Flow: Deciding how instructions execute (conditions, loops).
    - Functions: Breaking code into reusable blocks.
    - Algorithms: Step-by-step method to solve a problem.

//---> FLOWCHARTS
    
/*
    A flowchart is a diagram that represents the steps of an algorithm or process.

    Common Flowchart Symbols:
    - Oval        : Start / End
    - Rectangle   : Process (an action or step)
    - Diamond     : Decision (yes/no, true/false)
    - Parallelogram: Input / Output
    - Arrows      : Flow of control (direction)

    Example (conceptual):
    [Start] --> [Input Number] --> [Is it Even?] --> Yes --> [Print Even] --> [End]
                                               \
                                                No --> [Print Odd] --> [End]
*/


//---> PSEUDOCODE
   
/*
    Pseudocode is a simplified, human-readable description of an algorithm.
    It looks like code but ignores strict syntax.

    Example:
    BEGIN
        INPUT number
        IF number % 2 == 0 THEN
            PRINT "Even"
        ELSE
            PRINT "Odd"
        ENDIF
    END
*/


//---> ALGORITHMS

/*
    Definition:
    An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem.

    PROPERTIES OF A GOOD ALGORITHM:
    - Input: Zero or more inputs
    - Output: At least one result
    - Definiteness: Clear and unambiguous steps
    - Finiteness: Must terminate after finite steps
    - Effectiveness: Each step must be basic enough to be carried out

    Eg: Algorithm to find the largest of two numbers
    1. Start
    2. Input A, B
    3. If A > B, print A
    4. Else print B
    5. End
